The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for various modern desktop and server operating
systems, such as UNIX and Windows NT.  The goal of this project is to
provide a secure, efficient and extensible server which provides HTTP
services in sync with the current HTTP standards.

This package adds support for Unix domain sockets (UDS) to mod_proxy.

So the host portion of the URL contains "socket=" followed by the URI
encoded socket path (upper case characters must be encoded too). Below
are a couple of examples where PHP-FPM's socket is /tmp/php-fpm.sock
and the document root is /local/htdocs:

ProxyPass fcgi://socket=%2ftmp%2fphp-fpm.sock/local/htdocs/

RewriteRule (.*\.php) fcgi://socket=\%2ftmp\%2fphp-fpm.sock/local/htdocs/$1 [P,L]

The following are not contained in the patch:
* bump MMN due to mod_proxy.h changes
* assign APLOGNO numbers
* detection of AF_UNIX support in configure
